Library project for TOP intermediate JS.

Good, fun project. it was very very difficult to figure out the JS and CSS code to add elements and then style them. 

Other than that, the tough part was figuring out how to append items to the array from the form. 

The entry form awkwardly makes the screen bigger, a popup would be a better solution. 

I used fixed card widths and auto overflow which made the cards wrap well and better
than previous projects. it also helped there were way less main elements. Just the 
header main content and cards. 

First time I felt like I could make a useful app while combining JS, HTML and CSS.
